# Blog Images

This directory contains images for blog posts. Each blog post should have its own subdirectory named after the blog post slug.

Example structure:
/assets/blogs/blog-post-slug/hero.jpg
/assets/blogs/blog-post-slug/image1.png
/assets/blogs/blog-post-slug/image2.jpg

For now, blog posts will use placeholder gradient backgrounds until actual images are added.
