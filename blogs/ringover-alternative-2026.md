# Best Ringover Alternative for Sales Teams 2026: AI Sales vs. Basic VoIP

![Ringover Alternative for Sales Teams](/assets/blogs/justcall-alternatives-banner.png)

[Ringover](https://ringover.com) offers transparent pricing and reliable VoIP functionality for basic business calling needs. However, **reliable phone service isn't the same as effective sales automation**. While Ringover handles call connectivity well, it requires human agents for all conversations and provides no sales intelligence.

If you're searching for a **Ringover alternative** that doesn't just connect calls but actually drives sales results, this comprehensive guide will show you why **LayCal** is the intelligent evolution beyond basic VoIP systems.

## The Ringover Reality: Reliable but Manual

### Ringover's Sales Limitations:

**❌ Basic VoIP Only** - Just connects calls without any sales intelligence  
**❌ Human-Dependent Process** - Every conversation requires a human agent  
**❌ No Sales Automation** - Manual dialing, talking, and follow-up required  
**❌ No Lead Qualification** - Agents must manually assess each prospect  
**❌ No Conversation Intelligence** - Basic call recording without insights  
**❌ Limited Scalability** - Growth requires hiring more agents  

## LayCal: The AI-Powered Ringover Alternative
