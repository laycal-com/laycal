![Dialpad Alternative for Sales Teams](/assets/blogs/justcall-alternatives-banner.png)

[Dialpad](https://dialpad.com) offers a comprehensive business communications platform with AI-enhanced features like transcription and sentiment analysis. While Dialpad excels as an enterprise communication solution, **many sales teams discover it's not optimized for outbound sales success**.

**❌ High Enterprise Pricing** - Expensive for teams only needing outbound sales functionality
